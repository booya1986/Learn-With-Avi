## 🌐 Bilingual Messaging Strategy

### When to Use Hebrew vs English

**Hebrew-First Contexts:**
- Israeli market campaigns
- Local partnerships
- Hebrew content creators
- Student-facing UI

**English-First Contexts:**
- International investors
- Global partnerships
- Technical documentation
- API references

**Bilingual Contexts:**
- Marketing website (both versions)
- Social media (alternate or mixed)
- Email (user preference)
- Product UI (user selects)

### Hebrew Messaging Nuances

1. **Direct Address**: Hebrew speakers prefer direct "אתה" (you) vs formal English
2. **Action-Oriented**: Hebrew CTAs more imperative ("התחל", "נסה")
3. **Shorter Sentences**: Hebrew text runs longer, keep sentences concise
4. **Cultural References**: Israeli tech community, IDF tech units, 8200, startup nation
5. **Code-Switching OK**: Technical terms can stay English (RAG, API, AI, ML)
