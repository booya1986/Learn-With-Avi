   - ✅ "Get instant answers based on what you're watching"

2. **Use concrete numbers**
   - ❌ "Students learn faster"
   - ✅ "Students complete courses 3x faster"

3. **Tell stories, not specifications**
   - ❌ "Voice input uses Whisper API"
   - ✅ "Ask questions while cooking—no typing required"

4. **Speak the user's language**
   - Hebrew speakers: Natural Hebrew, RTL
   - Developers: Technical but accessible
   - Beginners: Avoid jargon, use analogies

### ❌ DON'T

1. Don't oversell ("world's best")
2. Don't use jargon without context
3. Don't ignore the competition
4. Don't focus only on technology
5. Don't use passive voice

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific About Audience**
   - Specify student, instructor, organization, or investor
   - Example: "Create email for students who haven't logged in for 7 days"

2. **Mention the Channel**
   - Different platforms need different formats
   - Example: "Write Twitter thread (not LinkedIn post)"

3. **Specify Language Preference**
   - Request "in Hebrew," "in English," or "bilingual"
   - Example: "Generate FAQ in both English and Hebrew"

4. **Indicate Tone**
   - Casual, professional, technical
   - Example: "Write casual blog post" vs "formal press release"

5. **Reference the Frameworks**
   - Use framework names for better results
   - Example: "Create case study using Hero's Journey framework"
